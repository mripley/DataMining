Preliminary dataset:
	sample5574-from-SPSS.csv.zip	SPSS exported this. It's ugly and there are no export options to make it better.
	sample5574-from-SPSS-into-Access.mdb.zip	SPSS can do a direct dump to Access format as well.
	sample5574-from-SPSS-into-Access.csv.zip	Dumping to Access, and then exporting from Access lead to this CSV. It fulfills many more of the requirements.
	sample5574-from-SPSS-into-Access.xml.zip	Dumping to Access, and then exporting from Access lead to this XML. I have no idea what to do with it.
	md5sums	Why you no md5sum?
Some other versions of this used 7z format.
