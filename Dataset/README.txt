Preliminary dataset:
	sample5574-from-SPSS.csv.7z	SPSS exported this. It's ugly and there are no export options to make it better.
	sample5574-from-SPSS-into-Access.mdb.7z	SPSS can do a direct dump to Access format as well.
	sample5574-from-SPSS-into-Access.csv.7z	Dumping to Access, and then exporting from Access lead to this CSV. It fulfills many more of the requirements.
	sample5574-from-SPSS-into-Access.xml.7z	Dumping to Access, and then exporting from Access lead to this XML. I have no idea what to do with it.
	md5sums	Why you no md5sum?
